# Permission

`cdump.dump` - permission for all cdump commands

# Usage

1. Make a WorldEdit selection
2. Type /cdump start
3. Wait for it to complete (you will get an ETA and updates intermittently)
4. When it's done, type `/cdump inspect <index>` where `<index>` is a non-negative integer in the range reported by the command upon complection of the dump.
5. Alternatively, use `/cdump tp <index>` to tp to the chest.

# Commands
